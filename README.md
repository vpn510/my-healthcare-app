⚠️ Potential Issues & Solutions

1. Tailwind styles not applying?

Issue: Styles are not reflecting in the browser.

Solution:

Ensure tailwind.config.js is properly configured.

Verify your main CSS file includes:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Also confirm PostCSS and Tailwind dependencies are installed.

2. React Router not working after deployment?

Issue: Routes return 404 on refresh or deep linking.

Solution:

If using Netlify, add a _redirects file to the public/ folder:

/*    /index.html   200

For other hosts, refer to their SPA support docs.

3. ESLint throwing errors or not working?

Issue: Lint errors or ESLint not detecting code issues.

Solution:

Run linting manually using:

npm run lint

Ensure .eslintrc is correctly set up.

Install missing peer dependencies (e.g., ESLint plugins).

4. Blank screen or component not rendering?

Issue: After starting dev server, app shows a blank screen.

Solution:

Check browser console for any runtime errors.

Ensure App.jsx and main.jsx are properly wired.

Verify correct usage of React Router <Routes> and <Route>.

5. Tailwind IntelliSense not working in VSCode?

Issue: No autocomplete or highlighting for Tailwind classes.

Solution:

Install the "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" VSCode extension.

Make sure your project has tailwind.config.js at the root.
